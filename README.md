# MoLL

MoLL is a GUI for correcting tags and lemmas in previously tagged and lemmatized text.
For now it is only available for the MIM-GOLD 20.05 tagset but in the future it's functionality
should be extened so that users will be able to add their own tagsets.

The documentation "MoLL_grein.pdf" is in Icelandic only since the program is, so far, only for the use of
correcting tags for Icelandic tagsets.

## Update (April 2021)

Modifications have been made to make MoLL more tagset independent. This mean that, following the right structure,
MoLL should be able to use any custom tagging schema.

*In depth instructions for tagging schema setup will be uploaded soon*
