# MoLL

MoLL is tool for correcting tags and lemmas in previously tagged and lemmatized text.
For now it is only available for the MIM-GOLD 20.05 tagset but in the future it's funtionality
should be extened so that users will be able to add their own tagsets.

The documentation "MoLL_grein.pdf" is in Icelandic only since the program is, so far, only for the use of
correcting tags for Icelandic tagsets.
